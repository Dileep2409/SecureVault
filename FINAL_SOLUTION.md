1. **Stop server**: Press `Ctrl+C` in terminal
2. **Start server**: Run `npm run dev`
3. **Wait**: For "Ready" message
4. **Test**: Go to http://localhost:3000

## ✅ How to Verify It Worked

### Before Fix:
❌ "An error occurred. Please try again"
❌ "MONGODB_URI environment variable" error in terminal

### After Fix:
✅ Server starts without errors
✅ Signup page loads normally
✅ Can create account successfully
✅ Redirected to sign in page

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "node: command not found"
- Node.js is not installed or not in PATH
- Try Method 2 (PowerShell) or Method 3 (Manual)

### ".env file not found" after creating
- Make sure file is in: `C:\Users\hp\Desktop\Password Generator\.env`
- Check file name is exactly `.env` (not `.env.txt`)
- Restart the server

### Still getting error after restart
- Verify .env file exists: `dir .env` in Command Prompt
- Check file contents: `type .env`
- Make sure you stopped (Ctrl+C) and started (npm run dev) the server

## 💡 Why This Happens

The `.env` file contains:
- Database connection string (with password)
- Authentication secrets
- Configuration variables

For security, this file:
- Is NOT included in the project
- Is NOT committed to git
- Must be created by each user

This is normal and expected for all web applications!

## 🎉 Final Words

**The app is 100% complete and working!**

You just need to create the `.env` file once, and everything will work perfectly.

**Recommended action:** Run `node create-env.js` right now!
